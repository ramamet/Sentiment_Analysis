# Sentiment_Analysis
###### Web scraping and Text Analytics

Stocks price movement normally depends on investors' sentiment on the concern. 
Every day, we collect various news about the company through different sources like GoogleNews, YahooFinance, Social    Networks sites and Printed medias. 
        So concentrating and monitoring a particular stock is a complex task. Data collection and cleaning of the text data from the web sources are the key steps on Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. We need to sort out positive and negative news with proper scoring pattern. In this work, I use R package "tm" for sentiment analysis with support of other packages for cleaning and plotting theme web mined data.
